# logo-maker
as a developer i want to create a program to save people from having to hire out making logos.

in application lets the user easily and quickly make a very basic logo without any of the hassle of finding a graphic designer

the main challenge that i faced with this project is that i have not been able to figure out why the data I enter is not being saved into the logo.svg filed
